# Art Gallery State: Secure Log File 

This project consists of implementing a secure log file to describe the state of an art gallery: the guests and employees who have entered and left, and persons that are in rooms. The project applies several security concepts including buffer overflow, integer overflow, confidentiality, and integrity attacks.
